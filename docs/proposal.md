## 1. Summary of the Project 

#### 1.1 Setup and Goals

In this project, our team is planning to develop a intelligent agent under Temple Run like setting. The goal of this AI is to collect as many points (diamonds/gold) as possible, while trying to escape from the ghost. There are different kind of challenges like wide gap, obstacles on the top and dip along the way. Thus, we plan to implement a random map generator combining different obstacles, which also supports seed functionality.

#### 1.2 Possible Input&Output

The output of our AI will combination of move right/left, jump, and use items/potions.

The input of our agent could be raw pixels on the screen, or the blocks that is close to the agent.
